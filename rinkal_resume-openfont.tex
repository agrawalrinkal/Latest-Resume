\runsubsection{Software Engineer ii }\hfill\  \location{Nov '18 – Present} 
\location{Software Engineer I \hfill June '17 - Nov '18}  
\location{CenturyLink}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}
\item Built a full-stack data-driven application using Angular6 on node.js and Java to provide a user interface for multiple inventories, leading to 40\% fewer error tickets. As a product owner, decided feature directions, worked with users to gather requirements and feedback.
\item Implemented an automation solution in Java for SD-WAN technology by closely working with different business units, resulting a decrease in device activation time from 30+ minutes to just over 4 minutes.
\item Built a server-side routing engine using JavaScript and JSON on express.js to route the incoming traffic based on the request, resulting in over 20\% decrease in client load.
\item Increased the legacy server engine efficiency by 4 folds, by rewriting the algorithm using SNMP technology.
\end{tightemize}
